# tdosca-tc09-dualhw-gradle
This application is used as a test-case for the project OSCake
which can be found here: https://github.com/telekom/ort

It represents a simple "Hello World" program which includes dual licenses and copyright statements
on different folder levels and in source code files (hierarchical overlapping). It is only used
for scanning the files and not to implement anything great. The defined dependencies (see build.gradle.kts)
are only used in order to have other packages (with dual/compound licenses) to work with.

Its main purpose (difference to tdosca-tc08-dualhw) is to have a test case using the "gradle"-package manager mixed with "Maven"-packages.
